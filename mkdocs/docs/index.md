# Uncrustify configuration examples

The [uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) is a tool that helps
to format code according to some rules. 

There are more than six hundreds processing rules for now. This project aims 
to provide definite examples for each rule. Also there will be provided 
ready-to-use configurations for existing style guides.

However right now only few examples are available.

## Commands

There are few groups of _uncrustify_ configuration rules:

* *Spacing options* 
* *Indenting options*
* *Newline adding and removing options*
* *Positioning options*
* *Line splitting options*
* *Code alignment options*
* *Comment modification options*
* *Code modifying options*
* *Preprocessor options*
* *Other options*

## Ready configs for style guides

Will be implemented later.
