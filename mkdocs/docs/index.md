# Uncrustify configuration examples

The [uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) is a tool that helps
to format code according to some rules. 

There are more than six hundreds processing rules for now. This project aims 
to provide definite examples for each rule. Also there will be provided 
ready-to-use configurations for existing style guides.

However right now only few examples are available.

## More info on configuration options

The uncrustify itself is a good source of information. Try
```
uncrustify --show-config
```
and read until end of file.

Also [demo page](https://cdanu.github.io/uncrustify_config_preview/index.html) 
of [this project](https://github.com/CDanU/uncrustify_config) has a lot of examples
